\section*{Abstract:}

The aim of this practical assignment was to implement and analyze a multi-objective genetic algorithm with the goal of obtaining the solution of the magic square problem, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. The algorithm that was chosen for this task is the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Simulations with different parameter values were conducted and the performance of the algorithm was measured. The first part of the documentation explains different aspects of the workings of the algorithm and in the second part the results of the carried out simulations are presented and discussed.
