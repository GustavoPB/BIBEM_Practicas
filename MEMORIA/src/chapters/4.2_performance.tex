Evolution Algorithm Performance Indicators}

\ \ The performance of the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm is estimated using quantitative performance measures implemented in the MOEA Framework Java Library. The  ve performance indicators are: Hypervolume (HV), Generational Distance (GD), Inverted Generational Distance (IGD), Additive epsilon Indicator (AEI) and Maximum Pareto Front Error (MPFE). The performance is measured both in terms of convergence and diversity. First a reference set is computed which will be used for comparison. Multiple simulations are run and the best solution obtained is used as the reference set.
