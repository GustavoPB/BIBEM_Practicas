Outline of the NSGA-II algorithm}

\ \ First the population is initialized as usual. Once the population is initialized it is sorted into fronts based on non-dominance. Each individual is assigned a fitness value corresponding to the front to which they belong to. In addition to fitness the crowding distance is calculated for each individual. If the non-dominance ranking of two individuals is equal, the crowding criteria is used to select the individual that gives the best crowding distance. Binary tournament selection is used to select parents from the population based on these two criteria. The selected population generates o spring from crossover and mutation operators. The population consisting of the current population and the current o spring is sorted again based on non-domination and crowding distance and the best N individuals are taken to form the new population, where N is the size of the population.
